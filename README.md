# testframework-awfulvalentine
start
This project is about creating a testing framework for website Awful Valentine: http://awful-valentine.com. 
It's written on Java using Maven builder. Also I use Selenium WebDriver and TestNG for developing and running tests.
In here you can see implementation of Page Object Model pattern and OOP.
I also use explicit waits, safe wrappers in BaseTest class and other.
There is a TestNG framework. You can see how to use TestNG annotations, parameters, DataProvider, how to implement cross browser testing. 
I also use importing data from xlsx files to pass them to DataProvider. 
And there is a possibility to take screenshots during tests.
